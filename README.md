## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **Vutor**: A super cool platform for tutoring for HS students (100+ users)!
- **pikto**: The spiritual successor of pick engine. Attempting to make it as overengineered as possible. 
- **Mtok Engine**: My makeshift game console "operating system", the development library for it, and a bunch of games for it too


## ðŸ”­ Current Projects that I haven't worked on for more than a month
- **Every Week**: Every week, I make a small and interesting 4-10 hour project
- **AKGameDev**: My club
- **unsatisfactory OS**: my terrible featureless operating system


Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š (I'd love to talk to you for any reason: tarassekanev@gmail.com)
