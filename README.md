## ðŸ”­ Current Projects

- **Vutor**: A super cool platform for tutoring for HS students (100+ users)!
- **Every Week**: Every week I make a small and interesting 4-10 hour project
- **AKGameDev**: My club
- **unsatisfactory OS**: my terrible featureless operating system
- **Mtok Engine**: my makeshift game console "operating system", the development library for it and a bunch of games for it too


Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š (I'd love to talk to you for any reason: tarassekanev@gmail.com)
